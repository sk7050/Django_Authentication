# Django_Authentication
The authentication that comes with Django is good enough for most common cases, but you may have needs not met by the out-of-the-box defaults. Customizing authentication in your projects requires understanding what points of the provided system are extensible or replaceable. This document provides details about how the auth system can be customized.  Authentication backends provide an extensible system for when a username and password stored with the user model need to be authenticated against a different service than Django’s default.  You can give your models custom permissions that can be checked through Django’s authorization system.  You can extend the default User model, or substitute a completely customized model.
